# Attendance Management Project – Part 01

This is the initial setup for the Attendance Management project.  
It contains a simple Java program to verify the environment and folder structure.

## Part 2 – Student and Course Classes

In this part, we:

- Added `Student` and `Course` classes in `src/com/school/`.
- Used arrays of `Student` and `Course` objects in `Main.java`.
- Displayed the list of students and courses in the console.

## Folder Structure

Attendance/
├─ src/
│  └─ com/
│     └─ school/
│        ├─ Main.java
│        ├─ Student.java
│        └─ Course.java
├─ README.md

## How to Compile
javac src/com/school/Main.java

## How to Run
